Hi, I am Rezak Souilah, a teacher of mathematcs at [University Yahia Fares Médéa](http://www.univ-medea.dz/). 

In the past, I worked on 

I studied Mathematics at [Ecole Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens-kouba.dz).


I made a chart to visualize my experiences and interests on some of the programming languages. I know. I know this is always contraversial. But it's just something quite self-entertaining to do. So bare with me and have fun reading that!
